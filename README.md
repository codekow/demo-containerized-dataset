# Containerized Datasets

The purpose of this repo show options around serving and
maintain datasets used for training machine learning models
by using common tools.

We can use the benefits of containers, immutability and versioning, to support [reproducibility and replicability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547546/) which are key
to **science**.
